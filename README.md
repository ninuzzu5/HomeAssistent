# Smart Home Simulation on Wokwi

**Wokwi** is an online electronics simulator that allows you to design and test circuits in a simple and intuitive way. This project is a simulation of a **smart home**, where you can control various electronic devices through a user-friendly interface.

## Project Description

The project aims to create an interactive simulation of a smart home, where you can control lights, appliances, sensors, and other devices through a simple and intuitive user interface. The goal is to demonstrate how smart home technology can improve quality of life by making the home smarter and more automated.

### Key Features
- **Light and Shutters Control**: Turn lights on and off in different rooms, you can do the same with the shutters.
- **Appliance Management**: Control appliances such as the refrigerator, washing machine, and oven.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Use sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality.
- **Security**: Activate and deactivate an alarm system and control security cameras.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and easy-to-use graphical interface to manage all devices. 

## Technologies Used
- **Wokwi**: Online electronics simulator.
- **Figma**: For create the idea of the UI and UX.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating the user interface.
- **Arduino**: For programming the simulated electronic devices.
- **Python**: For to create the subscriber that save in a DB.
- **MongoDB**: For save the data in a storage.
